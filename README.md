# meetup_midway
App thats lets you meet your friends halfway using public transit system in berlin.

## Browser demo

Open `index.html` directly in a browser (or publish the repository with GitHub Pages).
The page loads the GTFS subset from the `gtfs_subset/` folder and runs the two-person
simulation entirely in client-side JavaScript, printing debug information in the log area.
